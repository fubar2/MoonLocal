# MoonPhases
# ross lazarus modified from MoonPhase plugin
Domoticz plugin that updates a "Custom Sensor" Value with current state of Moon.
This value can be used later on in order to update any scripts or to be used just a cosmetic improvement.
Updated to show moon phases as they appear in the southern hemisphere if that's where the location is
Updated april 2019 to use trignometry instead of relying on free web services. Code is accurate enough for government work
as far as I can tell
